    <h1>Futures Council Election</h1>
    <p>Below are the candidates for the Futures Council. They are in no particular order as they are shuffled to avoid bias introduced by their order.</p>
    <p>Please take your time in making your selection as there is a lot at stake. You can vote as many times as you like, but only your most recent vote will count.</p>

    <label>E-mail: 
    <input type="email" 
           name="user_email"
           autocomplete="email" /></label>
    <p>We need your email address to identify you as a unique person. This is how we'll stop multiple votes etc. Be careful to put it in as <code>first_last@bvn.com.au</code> or your vote won't be counted.</p>
